As I started learning Data-Science I have created KNN model to detect type of iris-flower based on it's sepal/petal length/with.

I performed following task in developing this model: 
-Basic analysis
-Visualization
-Standardization
-Encode categorical value
-Split dataset into test & train dataset
-Performance evaluation
